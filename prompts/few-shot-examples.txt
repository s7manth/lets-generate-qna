Examples of Expected Results:
Question 1:
In a feed-forward neural network used for NLP tasks in PyTorch, what is the role of the `nn.Embedding` layer?
A) To reduce the dimensionality of input data
B) To encode categorical variables as one-hot vectors
C) To map word tokens to vectors of fixed size
D) To perform normalization of word vectors

Explanation:
C) The `nn.Embedding` layer in PyTorch is used to map word tokens (usually represented as integer indices) to vectors of a fixed size. This is a form of a lookup table where each unique token is associated with a vector, and it serves as a trainable layer in the network.

Question 2:
When using a feed-forward neural network for classification in NLP, what is the purpose of applying a softmax function in the final layer?
A) To convert the output to binary values
B) To select the neuron with the maximum value as the output
C) To amplify the activation of neurons
D) To transform the output into a probability distribution over predicted output classes

Explanation:
D) The softmax function is applied to the final layer of a feed-forward neural network in classification tasks to transform the raw output scores (logits) into a probability distribution over the predicted output classes. It ensures that all outputs sum to 1 and can be interpreted as probabilities.
