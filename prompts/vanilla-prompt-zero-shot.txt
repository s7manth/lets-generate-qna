Instructions:
Create 10 multiple choice questions (MCQs) along with their correct answers and three plausible 
incorrect options for an advanced undergraduate course in <<TOPIC>>. Ensure that the questions 
are clear, concise, and test the understanding of fundamental concepts. 
The correct answer should be logically sound and justifiable. 
Provide a brief explanation for each correct answer. 

Ensure that the options/distractors are of high quality and the question is of reasonable difficulty. 
The quiz should be solvable and help us to test the understanding of the student. 

Guidelines:
- The question stem should present a focused technical problem or scenario relevant to key computer 
  science concepts covered in the course. Avoid vague or ambiguous wording.
- Answer choices should include one unambiguously correct answer, and several plausible but incorrect 
  distractors that require careful thought and analysis.
- Distractors should test common student misconceptions, highlight key differences between related 
  concepts, or require careful attention to technical details described in the question.
- Explanations should clearly validate why the correct answer is right and incorrect choices are wrong. 
  Explain common student mistakes addressed by each distractor.  
- Questions should have a suitable difficulty level - not too easy but not unreasonably difficult. 
  Aim for around 60-70% of strong students to answer correctly.
- Use varied technical question formats like algorithm analysis, coding problems, output interpretation, 
  debugging exercises, system design, etc. aligned to course learning outcomes.
- Avoid overly similar questions testing the same concept. Design questions that address a diverse set 
  of important topics and skills covered in the course.
- Questions should be solvable with the core knowledge and skills students are expected to develop in 
  the course, without relying on obscure trivia.
- Ensure questions are fully self-contained, with all information required stated in the stem.
- Review questions for clarity, accuracy, technical correctness, and lack of ambiguity prior to finalization.
- Just give the questions. No need to give any other peripheral text. 
- Ensure there is a mix of numerical, quantitative problems as well.
