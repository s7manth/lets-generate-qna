<<CONTEXT>>

Using the context provided, generate 10 multiple choice questions with at least 4 options each. Ensure each question is relevant to the context and has a single correct answer. Provide explanations for why the correct option is correct. Follow these guidelines:
- The questions should be clear, concise and cover key concepts from the context. Avoid vague or opinion-based questions. 
- The incorrect options should seem plausible but be clearly incorrect upon closer inspection. Do not use obviously wrong options.
- The explanations should clearly justify why the correct option is right based on information in the context.
- The questions and options should be free of spelling, grammar and factual errors.
- The questions should be varied in topic and style. Do not repeat similar phrasing or approaches multiple times.
- The questions should increase in difficulty/complexity as the set progresses.
- The correct answer should be randomized in position for each question.
- Give me a mix of numerical and theoritical questions. 
- Remember that these questions are for advanced undergraduate courses in Computer Science.
